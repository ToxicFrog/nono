Terminal: lowest-level interface, basically a vt220
Screen: layer on top of terminal, basically a framebuffer
  set cell
  clear
  refresh
  readInput/pollInput
  doResizeIfNecessary should be called at the start of each drawing pass to handle SIGWINCH events
TextGraphics: layer on top of screen, convenience functions for drawing strings, shapes, setting default colours, etc.
MultiWindowTextGUI: the only concrete GUI implementation, runs on top of Screen (automatically grabs the TextGraphics and stuff).
Window: the basic element of the MWTGUI. Window layout is handled by the WM in the MWTGUI; the window can have hints attached to it to modify this behaviour. By default there's no bindings for focus switching, and all windows are modal; you create one and then call window.waitUntilClosed() to block until it goes away.
A window can only contain one widget. Typically this is a Panel, which has a layout manager and lets you put multiple other components into it.
